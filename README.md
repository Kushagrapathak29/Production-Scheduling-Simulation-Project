The task involves simulating a shift-wise production schedule for multiple components that are manufactured on different machines, following a defined sequence for a given order. The challenge is to calculate and optimize the production timeline, considering the order priority, machine capabilities, and constraints such as changeover time between components and minimum batch sizes required to move from one machine to another. The production simulation must account for various factors including machine shift schedules, component processing times, and the impact of changeover times on overall production efficiency. The goal is to identify whether the required number of orders can be produced within a given time frame (such as a month), determine any bottleneck machines that slow down the process, calculate the longest lead time based on the selected machine sequence, and create a machine loading plan. Additionally, a matrix between machines and shifts is needed to understand how each machine is utilized during each shift, although this part is complex due to the large datasets and the dynamic nature of the production process. The project requires simulating the entire production process while optimizing machine usage, minimizing downtime, and meeting order delivery deadlines.
